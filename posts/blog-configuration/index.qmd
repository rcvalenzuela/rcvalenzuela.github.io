On this post I keep a record of all the steps needed to configure/publish the blog

## Publishing to github-pages

I follow the steps described in the [Publish command](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command) section of the Github pages part of the quarto documentation.

In order to use quarto publish from the command line I create a Personal Access token using the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)

## Adding custom domain

We configure only the main `.github.io` repository with a custom domain in Github as explained in the guide [Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#about-custom-domain-configuration)

The guide states that you must only configure a `CNAME` in the DNS settings but it was necessary to add four `A Record` as explained in the [configuring an apex domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain) section of the same page.
