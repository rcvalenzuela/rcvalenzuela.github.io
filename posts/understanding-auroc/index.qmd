## Introduction

Area under the ROC curve is a metric measuring the performance of a binary classifier. Its value can be interpreted as *the probability that randomly chosen instance from the positive class will have a higher score than a randomly chosen instance of the negative class*.

The question being studied in this post is: **How is the previous statement derived and can we see examples of it?**

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
```

```{python}
df_preds = pd.DataFrame({'y_true':[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
                         'y_pred':[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1]}).reset_index()
```

```{python}
roc_auc_score(df_preds['y_true'], df_preds['y_pred'])
```

```{python}
